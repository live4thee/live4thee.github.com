Today [Yyk](http://yyk.colorfulwe.com/) and I paid a visit to
[Xiaowei](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sh1ne), and others alongside.

This is the first time I visit Xiaowei's startup. After a few
discussion, Xiaowei showed us a demo. I am impressed, not only the
product itself, but more about the passion. The passion to create
something that is amazing, and the belief that we can take challenges.

I talked few. I was thinking about my life, my dream. Probably the
most meaningful conclusion I had then, is, "Have trust, and show
respect."  Have trust in ourselves and show respect to others.

There were other talks. And friends, I hope your dreams will come
true. Keep fighting!
