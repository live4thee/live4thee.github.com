Tonight my wife signed a contract to buy an apartment, so that our son
can attend a better school. Still, I do not buy in the reason, because
I believe that the best education comes from the family, the role
model we would build up for, and the belief we would pass to, our son.

I was irritated (although remained calm and silence), when one day, my
wife asked, "Do you love our son?  My colleagues all have actively
bought apartments for their child's education! Why don't you?"

`Love is blind`. Love is **not** measured by an apartment.  It can be
a `reason` to make a decision, but far from a `guarantee` to make a
good decision.  I am writing this post to keep a record of my thoughts
at the moment, not to blame.

Choosing a wife/husband == choosing a life. We need to be responsible
for what we chose, anyway.
